qt modules for Qore
version 0.0.3 by David Nichols

Requires qore 0.7.1+ headers and libraries to build.
Requires QT 4.3 or newer headers and libraries to build, with QT 4.5 the
module is tagged as LGPL instead of GPL (so it can be opened regardless of how
the library was initialized).
qt-opengl requires also OpenGL headers and libraries to build and the qore
"opengl" module to run

modules:
* qt-core
* qt-gui
* qt-opengl
* qt-svg
